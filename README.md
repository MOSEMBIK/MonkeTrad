# MonkeTrad

Just a simple program that encode and decode between
human classic latin ABC & "RDIML, Reims' DUT Info
2020's Monke Language" (all right reserved).
    
    Disclamer :
            This code is not based on science. It
            dosen't make you able to speak the
            monkey's language.
